#+TITLE: Hallucination / Prompt Schema
#+author: Dean Cahill

* Types of Hallucination
** Incorrect Information
- Factual information
  - Mistakes
  - short answer not in output (binary correct/incorrect)
- Applicative/Synthesis information
  - Proof-type errors
  - EM/faithfulness between expected answer and output
  - *** hard to evaluate

* Types of Prompt Repetition
** Iterative
- Simply repeat the prompt many times, observe the variation
- Attempt this both in
** Contradictive
- Inform the model that the output is incorrect
- various phrasings & extremities
  - "I don't know about that response"
  - "That response"
** Alternative / "Stylistic"
- Ask the model to repeat itself
- Provide additional modifications to the request
  - "Could you {say|word} that {again|a different way|differently}?"
  - "Could you repeat that?"
  - "Could you repeat that, but {x}"
** Contextual
- Attempt to engineer the prompts specifically to avoid hallucination
- Multiple forms of context
  - Naive => provide prompt context for the QA task
  - Aware => provide prompt context *for the hallucination task*

* Relevant Hyperparameters for tuning
** Temperature
