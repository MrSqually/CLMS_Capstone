* Progress
** Codebase
*** Implementation moving smoothly
- Topic Model => ~90% there
    - Pipeline is built
    - Need to parse the html into the relevant text for clustering
- Structure of the prompting task is there, just need to fill in the loops

*** Runtime Considerations
- How many repetitions? Aim for significance? 50-100? more?
    - modulating (shrinking) the size of the dataset to encourage more repetitions
- Hardware requirements on running QA-GNN
- Reduced version of NQ (just text - not HTML), should be able to run on whole dataset

** Roadmap
*** Immediate Progress
- Should have everything except for the QAGNN work ready to run by the end of the weekend
- no training required for baseline task
- A bit concerned about running QA_GNN => student compute cluster?

*** Deliverables
**** Paper, Repo, Presentation
***** Paper Length?
***** Presentation Length?
